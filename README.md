## Usage ##

Browse: use any your favourite markdown browser. Such as
[markdown-preview](https://github.com/iamcco/markdown-preview.nvim) which I
used.

Compile: use any your favourite markdown compiler. Such as
[pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc) which I used.

Some pictures need latex compiler. Such as
[texlive](https://github.com/TeX-Live/texlive-source) which I used.

Thanks to Teacher Rui.
He forces us to use computer to write homework in the period of Corona Virus
Disease 2019.
So I believe it can be helpful.
